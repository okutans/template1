<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how:</strong> Our music will be played by our friends and fans for a cause. How do we know? Well, because our music is so good, we&#8217;ve been asked to play it at charity concerts around the world for people who are sick or have suffered from war and conflict. We believe that music has an incredible power to heal and bring life back into focus, especially when surrounded by people who care about you. And we think that everyone deserves that kind of treatment—no matter where they live or how much money they make.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-spread-the-word-the-end-is-not-near-the-end-is-now">So spread the word: The End is not Near! The End is Now!</h3>



<p>So instead of just playing songs for fun and playing in bars, we&#8217;re going to take our music online. We&#8217;ll be raising money for charity so we can help people during this difficult time.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover is-light has-parallax alignfull basscover" style="background-image:url(https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/alex-radelich-rtCfGTI7nCA-unsplash.jpg)"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__gradient-background has-background-dim"></span><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Sign up for our first online music session to help people in need in Africa!</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link">Sign up</a></div>
</div>
</div></div>



<p>We can both agree on one thing: there are people in need. Stress is everywhere. There’s so much uncertainty about what is happening next, and when, and how it will affect us that it’s hard to go about our daily lives. Now imagine being in a war-torn country or living in poverty or being sick – all the things you have to deal with must seem insurmountable. </p>



<p>So here’s the good news: we are giving our music to charities so they can play them at live events – where people can come out, listen to great music and be part of something bigger.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re coming back with a new album!</p>



<p>We know it&#8217;s been a little while. We wanted to keep our heads down, get some rest, and recharge after the whirlwind of our last tour.</p>



<p><strong>But we were listening—and we heard you.</strong> We heard all of you telling us that you missed us and couldn&#8217;t wait for more music from us. And we couldn&#8217;t let you down!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="check-out-gregg-during-recording">Check out Gregg during recording!</h3>



<p><em>We&#8217;ll be selling our new album at all of these shows, and we can&#8217;t wait to see you again.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gabriel-gurrola-2UuhMZEChdc-unsplash-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131" srcset="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gabriel-gurrola-2UuhMZEChdc-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gabriel-gurrola-2UuhMZEChdc-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gabriel-gurrola-2UuhMZEChdc-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gabriel-gurrola-2UuhMZEChdc-unsplash-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gabriel-gurrola-2UuhMZEChdc-unsplash-1300x868.jpg 1300w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gabriel-gurrola-2UuhMZEChdc-unsplash-600x401.jpg 600w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gabriel-gurrola-2UuhMZEChdc-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>So we&#8217;ve been writing, recording, and practicing like crazy over the last few months to make sure that this album is even better than the last. And it is. It will be out in the spring of 2020.</p>



<p>And we can&#8217;t wait to see all of you out on the road again! You guys are the best fans ever, and we love being able to see your smiling faces up close. So come out and join us on tour as we cheer each other on with some incredible shows!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We have just finished our Europe tour.</p>



<p>Not only did we sing in the most popular European venues, but we also took the time out to get to know some of the culture. We want to share with you some of the things we learned about Europe in our travels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/austin-neill-hgO1wFPXl3I-unsplash.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-39" srcset="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/austin-neill-hgO1wFPXl3I-unsplash.jpg 1920w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/austin-neill-hgO1wFPXl3I-unsplash-600x400.jpg 600w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/austin-neill-hgO1wFPXl3I-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/austin-neill-hgO1wFPXl3I-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/austin-neill-hgO1wFPXl3I-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/austin-neill-hgO1wFPXl3I-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/austin-neill-hgO1wFPXl3I-unsplash-1300x867.jpg 1300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="more-than-15-concerts-around-europe">More than 15 concerts around Europe</h3>



<p>But then it was time to go! We got on that plane, and when we landed in Paris—the first stop on our tour—we knew everything was going to be okay. People were waiting for us at the airport with signs—and they were singing our songs! People were singing them in the streets, in restaurants, in bars… everywhere we went, total strangers just started belting out those songs. And man did that feel good. To know that people loved those songs. That they still liked our music.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-are-not-done-yet">We are not done yet!</h3>



<p>That&#8217;s why we do what we do: because when you share your music with someone else, it&#8217;s like giving them a part of yourself. The best feeling in the world is knowing you&#8217;ve brought joy to another human being through your art.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52" srcset="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash.jpg 1920w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-600x400.jpg 600w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-1300x867.jpg 1300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>We learned a lot on this tour, too. We learned how to sing in different languages, which is hard but crazy-cool once you get the hang of it! We learned how to be professional on the road and how to make travel plans. The only thing we didn&#8217;t learn was how to take a good picture with a cell phone (you can see for yourselves).</p>

<p>We know our fans love our music, so we are taking steps to be more active in social media. We have partnered with <strong><a href="#">InStep Marketing</a></strong> to help us coordinate our social media presence and spend more time creating the music that you love.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="facebook-instagram-and-twitter">Facebook, Instagram and Twitter</h3>



<p>We will continue to post a new song every week here on Facebook, but you can also expect us to be posting more often on Instagram and Twitter as well!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="427" src="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/yvette-de-wit-NYrVisodQ2M-unsplash-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-35" srcset="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/yvette-de-wit-NYrVisodQ2M-unsplash-1.jpg 640w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/yvette-de-wit-NYrVisodQ2M-unsplash-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/yvette-de-wit-NYrVisodQ2M-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure>



<p>InStep has developed a marketing plan for us that involves a combination of paid and organic posts across all our platforms. We hope this will help spread our music to new audiences and give us the ability to reach new fans online.</p>

<p>Hey there, fans! We have some good news. We&#8217;re going to be revisiting our first studio album and creating covers for all the songs! But that&#8217;s not all! We will also be collaborating with other artists to record and release those covers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-did-we-come-up-with-this-idea">How did we come up with this idea?</h3>



<p>We came up with the idea after realizing how much you all love our music, and how much you all want to see us perform it live, but we aren&#8217;t able to get out on tour as much as we would like because of our commitment to Bunkion. When we realized that we could use this album to make sure you&#8217;re getting new content more often and still keep us close by, we were so excited!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/soundtrap-UKyJ3rWHNt8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-46" srcset="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/soundtrap-UKyJ3rWHNt8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/soundtrap-UKyJ3rWHNt8-unsplash-600x400.jpg 600w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/soundtrap-UKyJ3rWHNt8-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/soundtrap-UKyJ3rWHNt8-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/soundtrap-UKyJ3rWHNt8-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/soundtrap-UKyJ3rWHNt8-unsplash-1300x867.jpg 1300w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/soundtrap-UKyJ3rWHNt8-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re going to be kicking off these recordings in the next couple weeks, so stay tuned for more details about who is involved, what songs will be covered, what artists will be featured, and when exactly it will all happen!</p>

<p>This past year has been full of change, growth, and adventure. From concerts, album releases, and many online events to working with charities and non-profit organizations to help people in need, we&#8217;ve been lucky enough to pack a lot of excitement into one year.</p>



<p>In the last 12 months, we&#8217;ve:</p>



<p>-Had a whole bunch of concerts across many genres</p>



<p>-Released a few albums that are doing quite well on the charts</p>



<p>-Made some pretty big announcements about our upcoming plans, including some exciting collaborations with key players in the industry</p>



<p>Additionally, we&#8217;ve been hard at work with charities and non profit organizations to help people who have fallen on hard times.</p>

<p>Going way back, 2021 was a huge year for us, with concerts and album releases that were all over the world. We also had a lot of fun online, including our new website, and some really great projects we did with charities and non-profit organizations.</p>



<p><strong>We&#8217;re still going strong this year, with a new album on the way, another charity concert coming up, and more surprises in store!</strong></p>

<p>We&#8217;re super excited to announce that we have a new band manager. Our old manager had been with us since the beginning, and he was super great, but he had other things to focus on, so we needed an upgrade.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="meet-david-kasinski-musician-and-manager">Meet David Kasinski, musician and manager</h3>



<p>We&#8217;re happy to say our new manager is stepping up to the plate. He&#8217;s already working hard to help us have more events where we can play live music for you guys, as well as listing our music in more online websites.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/daniel-wirtz-jmmTlAPtNw8-unsplash.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-135" srcset="https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/daniel-wirtz-jmmTlAPtNw8-unsplash.jpg 1920w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/daniel-wirtz-jmmTlAPtNw8-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/daniel-wirtz-jmmTlAPtNw8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/daniel-wirtz-jmmTlAPtNw8-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/daniel-wirtz-jmmTlAPtNw8-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/daniel-wirtz-jmmTlAPtNw8-unsplash-1300x867.jpg 1300w, https://demo.vivathemes.com/bass/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/daniel-wirtz-jmmTlAPtNw8-unsplash-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re also working on recording some new songs with him and getting them ready for you!</p>



<p>The new band manager will be hard at work helping us reach our goals. Not only will he make sure we have more events and get our music into more online places, but he&#8217;ll also make sure we keep our focus on the things that matter most: our art and our fans. We can&#8217;t wait to see what this new year holds for us, and we can&#8217;t wait to show you all these great new changes as they happen.</p>



<p>Thanks for sticking with us, and we hope you like what you see!</p>

<p>Hey there!</p>



<p>We wanted to tell you about our new music video for &#8220;Aviation&#8221;, which we think is the best video we&#8217;ve ever released. It&#8217;s got everything you could possibly want: Kevin, a whole lot of walking through the city, and a bunch of shots where we&#8217;re singing in front of a bunch of different things that are red! It&#8217;s great. </p>



<p>Plus, did we mention that it has Kevin? We probably should have mentioned that earlier.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="The Last Shadow Puppets - Aviation (Official Video)" width="1600" height="900" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fd1Xc6-6VVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The song was written by Charlie, a beautiful song about finding love in the most unexpected places. We think it&#8217;s a great theme for a music video, and we hope that you agree!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="story-behind">Story behind</h3>



<p>But first things first: This video is directed by Kevin, who also directed our previous music video, &#8220;Bring Me A Higher Love&#8221;. The guy has talent coming out of his ears. He&#8217;s also known for being our best friend since childhood. It was a no-brainer for us because he knows us and loves us and makes us laugh like nobody else can. We thought that would come across nicely in the video. And we were right!</p>



<p>Also starring in the video is the beautiful Lizzie Binder. She&#8217;s a model/actress from Chicago who has appeared on TV shows like &#8220;Palm&#8221;.</p>

<p>The video is cool and everything, but there&#8217;s something we want to talk to you about. Have you ever felt that there was someone out there waiting for you, someone who was made just for you? </p>



<p>Me neither! But I know now that you&#8217;re looking at this video right now, it&#8217;s really important that you actually pay attention to the lyrics. Go ahead and listen to the words, and think about this person who&#8217;s supposed to be &#8220;just like [me]&#8221;. If you feel like maybe you don&#8217;t have anyone like that in your life right now, then we need your help. Let us know if there&#8217;s anyone out there who might be perfect for us.</p>
