We got on that plane, and when we landed in Paris\u2014the first stop on our tour\u2014we knew everything was going to be okay. People were waiting for us at the airport with signs\u2014and they were singing our songs! People were singing them in the streets, in restaurants, in bars\u2026 everywhere we went, total strangers just started belting out those songs. And man did that feel good. To know that people loved those songs. That they still liked our music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"we-are-not-done-yet\">We are not done yet!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why we do what we do: because when you share your music with someone else, it&#8217;s like giving them a part of yourself. The best feeling in the world is knowing you&#8217;ve brought joy to another human being through your art.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https:\/\/demo.vivathemes.com\/bass\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-52\" srcset=\"https:\/\/demo.vivathemes.com\/bass\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/demo.vivathemes.com\/bass\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/demo.vivathemes.com\/bass\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/demo.vivathemes.com\/bass\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/demo.vivathemes.com\/bass\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/demo.vivathemes.com\/bass\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/demo.vivathemes.com\/bass\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/freestocks-LoppUA_9F1w-unsplash-1300x867.jpg 1300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We learned a lot on this tour, too.
